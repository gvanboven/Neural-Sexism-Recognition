## Automated Sexism Recognition

This repository contrains my code and report for the task of automated sexism recognition.  
I carry out this task by:   
i) implementing a neural network from scratch, based on the book "Make  your  own  neural  network book" by Rashid (2016).  
ii) training this neural network on the Sexist Workplace Statements Dataset (Grosz & Conde-Cespedes, 2020).   
iii) I evaluate the performance in my report.   
This project was done for the course 'Machine Learning for NLP' by Antske Fokkens and Jos√© Angel Daza at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

The file `NN.py` contains the script I adapted from the "Make  your  own  neural  network book" to build a Neural Network. 

I used this script in the file `Sexism_Experiments.ipynb`, which contains my experiments for the task of automated sexism recognition.   
In this file I use pretrained W2V and GloVe embeddings, which should be downloaded (from https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) and placed in the `./models` folder.
